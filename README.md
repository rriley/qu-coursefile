#Latex Template for Coursefile

This is a simple latex document to stitch together some PDFs into a
coursefile and include a linked table of contents. Basically, you
replace the PDFs with your information, properly include them in
the .tex files, and away you go.

If you don't know how to use Latex, this isn't for you.

See sample.pdf to get an idea of what this produces.
